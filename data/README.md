# PHOIBLE data

PHOIBLE is a database of phonological inventories and distinctive features,
encompassing more than 1600 languages (and growing). Here are links to various
parts of the project:

- The web-browsable published form of PHOIBLE is called “PHOIBLE Online” and
  is located at http://phoible.org. The data published there corresponds with
  the most recent [year-numbered
  release](https://github.com/phoible/data/releases) of this repository.

- This repository is https://github.com/phoible/data. Data in machine-readable
  form is available here. It contains the cleaned and aggregated data as a
  tab-delimited text file, and in binary form as an .Rdata file (for use with
  [R](http://www.r-project.org/)). It is not guaranteed to exactly match what
  is published at PHOIBLE Online, due to the occasional discovery and
  correction of errors and the addition of new languages. For this reason,
  **it is recommended that you make use of the most recent dated release in
  your own analyses**, rather than working from the tip of the master branch.

- The development repository is at https://github.com/phoible/dev. It contains
  scripts for aggregating the data into a single file, testing the consistency
  and integrity of the data, etc. That is where we make sure the proper IPA
  symbols are used, or that every unique phoneme has a unique representation
  in the distinctive feature system. Most users will never need to visit the
  development repository.

- The documentation is at http://phoible.github.io. This includes notational
  conventions, departures from official IPA usage, citation information, etc.
  If you have a question about PHOIBLE, chances are you should seek answers
  there first.

_All of these sites should be considered works-in-progress._ The “published”
form of the data is the most stable.
