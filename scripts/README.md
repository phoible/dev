# PHOIBLE scripts

To transform the raw data sources into aggregated PHOIBLE CSV and Rdata data files, run `Rscript aggregate-raw-data.R` (from a terminal) or `source('aggregate-raw-data.R')` from within R. Then to generate and append phonological features to the PHOIBLE CSV and Rdata files, run `Rscript add-features.R` (terminal) or `source('add-features.R')` (within R).
