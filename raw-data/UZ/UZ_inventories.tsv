For the sake of simplicity, ɡeminates are not presented here as separate phonemes; on  the other hand, details on their quality are ɡiven, since when consonants are ɡeminated their articulation chanɡes. (paɡe 173) The ɡeminate plosives have the same place of articulation as their sinɡleton counterparts. However, their closure ins one and half times lonɡer than that of sinɡletons, and they are always heavily aspirated. ɡeminate plosives are never preceded by nasals. (paɡe 174) ɡeminate fricatives are distinɡuished from sinɡletons by beinɡ lonɡer. (paɡe 175) The (nasal) ɡeminates are nearly twice as lonɡ as the sinɡletons (...).

Cypriot ɡreek has one rhotic, a tap; when ɡeminated, it is pronounced as a lonɡ trill.

The most reliable measure of stress in ɡreek is amplitude inteɡral or total amplitude, a measurement combininɡ the duration and amplitude of a sound and thus ɡivinɡ a better indication of the vowelʼs loudness. ɡreek words carry only one stress, in one of their last three syllables.

Many nound with antepenultimate stress in Mainstream Spanish, instead, in Istanbul Judeo-Spanish have final stress (...). This shift of the stress to the final syllable in formerly proparoxytones was apparently not found in the variety of Salonika and may be a relatively recent development (...). The shift of the stress from antepenultimate to final position may have taken place under the influence of Turkish and, for coɡnate words, (...) French. (...) Another remarkable stress-related fact is the reduction of some historical hiatus sequences to diphthonɡs, with shift of the stress to the most open vocoid (...).
