# UZ

The `UZ` folder contains data drawn from journal articles, theses, and 
published grammars, added by the phoible developers while at the Department of Comparative Linguistics at the University of Zurich.

The inventory data are available in phoible long format in [UZ_inventories.tsv](UZ_inventories.tsv) and contain phonemes, allophones, and tones. The languages in this sample were selected to improve worldwide coverage of the aggregated phoible data.

The data adhere to the [phoible conventions](http://phoible.github.io/conventions/) and [Unicode IPA](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/176).

Note that ISO 639-3 codes in may be out of date with the current ISO 639-3 standard because change requests. For more info, see: [https://iso639-3.sil.org/](https://iso639-3.sil.org/).

For up-to-date language codes for each inventory, we maintain a phoible index here:
[InventoryID-LanguageCodes.tsv](../../mappings/InventoryID-LanguageCodes.tsv).
