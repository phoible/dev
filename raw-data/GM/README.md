# GM

The `GM` folder contains data from African and Southeast Asian languages collected and edited by Christopher Green and Steven Moran. The data contain phonemes, allophones, and tones. The inventory data are available in phoible long format in [gm-afr-inventories.tsv](gm-afr-inventories.tsv) for the African languages and [gm-sea-inventories.tsv](gm-sea-inventories.tsv) for the Southeast Asian languages.

The data adhere to the [phoible conventions](http://phoible.github.io/conventions/) and [Unicode IPA](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/176).

We have also collected for each citation a BibTeX reference, available in the [phoible-references.bib](../../data/phoible-references.bib) file. See the [InventoryID-Bibtex.csv](../../mappings/InventoryID-Bibtex.csv) mapping file for details.

Note that the ISO 639-3 codes in the GM source may be out of date with the current ISO 639-3 standard. For more info, see: [https://iso639-3.sil.org/](https://iso639-3.sil.org/).

For up-to-date language codes for each inventory, we maintain a phoible index here:
[InventoryID-LanguageCodes.csv](../../mappings/InventoryID-LanguageCodes.csv).
