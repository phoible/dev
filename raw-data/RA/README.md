# RA

The `RA` folder contains data from:

> Ramswami, N. 1999. Common Linguistic Features in Indian Languages: Phonetics. Central Institute of Indian Languages. Mysore, India.

and was compiled by the phoible developers. The data are available in phoible wide format in [Ramaswami1999.tsv](Ramaswami1999.tsv) and contain only phonemes, with no information on allophones or linguistic tone.

We have converted IPA symbols in the raw data in line with the [phoible conventions](http://phoible.github.io/conventions/) and [Unicode IPA](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/176). We have also collected for each citation a BibTeX reference, available in the [Ramaswami1999.bib](Ramaswami1999.bib) file and also in the [phoible-references.bib](../../data/phoible-references.bib) file.

Note that ISO 639-3 codes in may be out of date with the current ISO 639-3 standard because change requests. For more info, see: [https://iso639-3.sil.org/](https://iso639-3.sil.org/).

For up-to-date language codes for each inventory, we maintain a phoible index here:
[InventoryID-LanguageCodes.tsv](../../mappings/InventoryID-LanguageCodes.tsv).
