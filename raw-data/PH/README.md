The `PH` folder contains data drawn from journal articles, theses, and 
published grammars, added by members of the Linguistic Phonetics 
Laboratory at the University of Washington. The contents are described in:

The inventory data are available in phoible long format in [phoible_inventories.tsv](phoible_inventories.tsv) and contain phonemes, allophones, and tones.

The data adhere to the [phoible conventions](http://phoible.github.io/conventions/) and [Unicode IPA](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/176).

Note that ISO 639-3 codes in may be out of date with the current ISO 639-3 standard because change requests. For more info, see: [https://iso639-3.sil.org/](https://iso639-3.sil.org/).

For up-to-date language codes for each inventory, we maintain a phoible index here:
