# PH

The `PH` folder contains phonological inventory data (phonemes, allophones, and tones) drawn from journal articles, theses, and published grammars. Collectively, they represent a convenience sample of languages and they were selected to improve worldwide coverage of the aggregated phoible data. Their source is tagged `phoible`.

The inventory data in [phoible_inventories.tsv](phoible_inventories.tsv) were added by members of the Linguistic Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Washington. The contents are described in:

> Moran, Steven. (2012). Phonetics Information Base and Lexicon. PhD thesis, University of Washington. Online: [https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/22452](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/22452).

The inventory data in [gm-afr-inventories.tsv](gm-afr-inventories.tsv) and [gm-sea-inventories.tsv](gm-sea-inventories.tsv) contain data from African and Southeast Asian languages collected and edited by Christopher Green and Steven Moran.

The inventory data in [UZ_inventories.tsv](UZ_inventories.tsv) were added by members of the Department of Comparative Linguistics at the University of Zurich.

All data in `PH` adhere to the [phoible conventions](https://phoible.org/conventions) and [Unicode IPA](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/176). For more information, see the [phoible FAQ](https://phoible.org/faq).

We have also collected for each citation a BibTeX reference, available in the [phoible-references.bib](../../data/phoible-references.bib) file. See the [InventoryID-Bibtex.csv](../../mappings/InventoryID-Bibtex.csv) mapping file for details.

Note that the ISO 639-3 codes in the PH source may be out of date with the current ISO 639-3 standard. For more info, see: [https://iso639-3.sil.org/](https://iso639-3.sil.org/).

For up-to-date language codes for each inventory, we maintain a phoible index here:
