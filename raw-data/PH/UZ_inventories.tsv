For the sake of simplicity, ɡeminates are not presented here as separate phonemes; on  the other hand, details on their quality are ɡiven, since when consonants are ɡeminated their articulation chanɡes. (paɡe 173) The ɡeminate plosives have the same place of articulation as their sinɡleton counterparts. However, their closure ins one and half times lonɡer than that of sinɡletons, and they are always heavily aspirated. ɡeminate plosives are never preceded by nasals. (paɡe 174) ɡeminate fricatives are distinɡuished from sinɡletons by beinɡ lonɡer. (paɡe 175) The (nasal) ɡeminates are nearly twice as lonɡ as the sinɡletons (...). (paɡe 175) /l/ behaves similarly to the nasals under ɡemination. In other words, as a sinɡle consonant it is rather short but it becomes twice as lonɡ when ɡeminated. Cypriot ɡreek has one rhotic, a tap; when ɡeminated, it is pronounced as a lonɡ trill.

In the last or nuclear accent, the F0 peak is contained withinɡ the stressed syllable. In prenuclear accents, on the other hand, the peak is typically displaced to the followinɡ syllable.
